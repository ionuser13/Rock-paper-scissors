# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a web version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was created as a fun and interactive way to demonstrate the use of JavaScript for dynamic user interaction and updating the web page without reloading.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Dynamic game play with real-time updates
- Score tracking with win, lose, and draw results (the match ends when one of the players reach 5 points)

## Usage

To start playing the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No installation or setup is required. Simply choose your desired game mode and start playing!
